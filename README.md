# Customer Retention Strategy for Model Fitness

This project focuses on developing a data-driven strategy to improve customer retention for Model Fitness, a gym chain. Through a combination of data analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling, the project identifies key factors influencing customer churn and provides actionable recommendations to enhance retention.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To predict the likelihood of customer churn and to create user profiles that help identify retention strategies.
- **Dataset:** The dataset contains 4,000 records of gym users with 14 features, including demographic information, membership details, and usage patterns.
- **Methodology:** The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), clustering, and building predictive models.

## Key Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyzed customer data to understand distributions, detect missing values, and identify correlations between features.
   - Visualized key distributions and correlations to derive initial insights.

2. **Clustering Analysis:**
   - Applied hierarchical clustering to identify five distinct user groups based on similar characteristics.
   - Conducted K-means clustering to refine the user segments and analyze feature distributions within each cluster.

3. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Built and evaluated two predictive models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to predict customer churn.
   - Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

4. **Churn Rate Analysis by Cluster:**
   - Calculated and visualized the churn rate for each cluster, highlighting significant variations in customer retention across different user segments.

## Findings

- **Proximity to Gym:** Local users show a lower propensity to churn, indicating that geographic proximity plays a crucial role in retention.
- **Friend Promotions:** Users who joined through friend promotions demonstrate higher loyalty in certain clusters.
- **Contract Duration:** Longer contract durations are associated with higher retention rates, especially in Clusters 1 and 4.
- **Additional Spending:** Users with higher additional spending on gym services tend to remain loyal, particularly in Cluster 4.
- **Churn Rates:** Cluster 2 shows the highest churn rate (49.2%), while Cluster 4 has the lowest (1.3%), indicating the need for targeted retention strategies.

## Recommendations

- **Strategic Partnerships:** Expand and strengthen partnerships with local and corporate companies to offer exclusive benefits and prolong gym membership.
- **Personalization:** Implement personalized customer service programs based on user behavior and preferences to enhance the individual experience.
- **Technological Innovation:** Introduce mobile apps with personalized fitness tracking, event notifications, and other features to increase engagement.
- **Community Building:** Organize regular group activities and events to foster a sense of community among members.
- **Education and Empowerment:** Offer educational programs on health, wellness, and advanced training techniques to empower members.
- **Continuous Analysis:** Establish a continuous data analysis cycle to monitor trends and adapt retention strategies proactively.
- **Long-Term Promotions:** Design promotional offers to incentivize long-term commitments and maximize the perceived value of gym membership.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive strategy for improving customer retention at Model Fitness by leveraging data analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling. The insights and recommendations are designed to be practical and directly applicable, offering a roadmap for enhancing customer loyalty and reducing churn.
